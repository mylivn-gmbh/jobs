We are a young and creative start-up from Munich, currently working on an app that connects social media to what’s happening locally and globally.
We created Mylivn with the goal of becoming an all-in-one app and a place inspired by people. We believe that through a combination of features, social aspects and potential connections, Mylivn can become one of the most unique and truly social apps.
Our key target is to become the world's largest social commerce platform. We achieve this by our own development of a high-performance platform that will transform the traditional online shopping experience to a groundbreaking modern and inspiring trading network. This basically defines our understanding of what we like to call ”the future of smart shopping".
