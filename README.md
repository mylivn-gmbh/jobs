We are a young and creative start-up from Munich, currently working on an app that connects social media to what’s happening locally and globally.
We created Mylivn with the goal of becoming an all-in-one app and a place inspired by people. We believe that through a combination of features, social aspects and potential connections, Mylivn can become one of the most unique and truly social apps.
Our key target is to become the world's largest social commerce platform. We achieve this by our own development of a high-performance platform that will transform the traditional online shopping experience to a groundbreaking modern and inspiring trading network. This basically defines our understanding of what we like to call ”the future of smart shopping".

## The Mylivn Approach 

Inventing products to provide richer and more interactive content on Mylivn for our users, bloggers and tradespeople is key for our daily motivation. We offer great opportunities for highly skilled talents with strong fundamental experience. We are growing fast and our target is to expand expeditiously throughout Europe, the United States and other regions around the world.

The secret to our success is our team’s ability to be creative, have a clear mission, and a knowledgeable approach to every situation. We are proud to be working with such inspiring international teammates who are smart, fun, ambitious, and looking for the challenge to transform social media and take it into the future.
